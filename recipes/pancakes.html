        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons melted butter or neutral oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat the eggs and milk until light and foamy, about 3 minutes at high speed (by hand or with mixer) Stir in the butter or oil.</li>
            <li>Whisk the dry ingredients together to evenly distribute them.</li>
            <li>Gently and quickly mix the dry ingredients into the wet solution. Let the batter rest for at least 15 minutes, so it thickens.</li>
            <li>Heat a frying pan over medium heat. Drop 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the lightly greased griddle.</li>
            <li>Cook on one side until bubbles begin to form and break, about 2 minutes; then turn the pancakes and cook the other side until brown, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Turn over only once. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
